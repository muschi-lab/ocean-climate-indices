# ocean-climate-indices
This repository provides R and Python scripts to calculate major climate indices—ENSO, PDO, and AMO—from surface ocean temperature data in CMIP model output or climate reanalysis. The scripts extract temperature data from NetCDF files, compute regional means, and output the indices as a time series.
